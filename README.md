**Sparrow** is an embedded operating system.

![SparrowOS](https://raw.github.com/michael2012z/Sparrow/master/doc/logo_280x160.png)

Now it supports S3C6410X chipset (ARM architecture) only, and run in Skyeye simulator.

The name "Sparrow" comes from a famous Chinese proverb - "Sparrow may be small but perfectly formed". I hope it has every important features of modern system, but not too complex.

To share the knowledge how an operating system is created, I compiled some document. But usually design document is always boring, so I made as many diagrams as possible to illustrate the most important mechanism. Hope the cartoon-style document let the readers feel relaxed. These slides are also available in doc folder of the repository.
